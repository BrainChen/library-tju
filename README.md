# library-tju
> This is my first project in my school, which can be used to search books in Tianjin University.
# background
> Well, it is uncomfortable to write English words as I am a Chinese student... With this project we can easily look up some fantastic books in our university, and the API is "pythoned" by our back-end team... During the work, I totally reformed this project by using jQuery an found it very useful... So this is why appears two projects in it.
> Besides, the UI prototypes are also in it, you can try to download it and learn to do it...
# I can do better:)
